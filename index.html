                <p>
                    Fred the Flopping Corgi has had a tough life of struggle and strife. As a child, he was trapped in a large icecube for years. It is becaues of this that he could not grow as large as he was supposed to. After that, he went to dog foster home to dog foster
                    home, feeling sad and unwanted.

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Professional Life</h3>
                <p>
                    After receiving the highest corgi education possible, Fred went on to bigger things. He became a veterinarian running his own practice. Fred received a Nobel Peace Prize for corgis at age 35 in dog years.

                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Ever since being abducted, he's a little paranoid, although he does like his owners a lot. He eats real good and they treat him like the strong independent corgi he is.
